== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Will this work with caching plugins?**

*Yes - This plugin should work with most caching plugins, even if the plugin merges JS and CSS files together. It should 

change the order in which they\'re merged into a new file. The only plugin that we know of it not being compatible with is 

[Better WordPress Minify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bwp-minify/)*

**What happens if I decide deactivate the plugin?**

*It will return your site to normal as it was before. The original order of files will be restored. This plugin makes no 

permanent changes to your WordPress sites structure.*
