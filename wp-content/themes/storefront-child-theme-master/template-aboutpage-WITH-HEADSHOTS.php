			<div class="ll-lead-intro say-hello">
				<p class="ll-lead-p">A couple of years ago I started trying to eat more healthily more often. But even though I worked in Leeds city centre I couldn’t find the sort of tasty and nutritious lunches I wanted for the office. </p>
				<p>So I started buying ingredients from the supermarket and compiling them at work. It was healthy and I had more energy...but it definitely wasn’t convenient or tasty. 	</p>
				<p>And it got really, really boring. </p>

							<p class="ll-lead-p">It got me thinking there has to be a better way – and the result is Lean Lunch, which I set up with my wife Charlotte. </p>
 
							<p>We both absolutely LOVE food, and think there’s no reason healthy lunches can’t be mouth-wateringly delicious and thoroughly satisfying. </p>
 
							<p>We want to make it easy for you and your colleagues to enjoy freshly made, totally tasty, nourishing food at work. Whether you’re eating alone, with friends or organising food for a meeting. </p>

						<div class="say-hello">
							<p class="ll-lead-p">Lean Lunch meals aren’t about restricting yourself. They’re about cramming as much good stuff and flavour into one meal as possible. </p>
				
							<p>We’re all for healthy fats, for example. They help keep you feeling full and your blood sugar levels balanced, and they’re great brain food. So by 3pm you’re much more likely to be powered up to finish the day on a high, rather than reaching for the digestives.  </p>
