The Company aim to state on the menu any ingredients that may cause an allergic reaction for someone with food allergies. Please be aware that we’ll be making your meal where we prepare foods, and use ingredients, containing many of the listed allergens so unfortunately we cannot guarantee that all our 
food is completely free of any allergen. If you have any type of food allergy the Company ask that you refrain from eating our food. The Company is not liable for any illness or medical reactions caused by contact with or consumption of our food.

Any order placed by you for goods advertised on our website is an offer by you to purchase the goods selected in your order.

Our acceptance of an order takes place when we dispatch the order or send you confirmation by email even if your payment has been processed immediately.

We may refuse at our discretion to accept an order:
(a) where we cannot obtain authorisation for your payment;

To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases.
