<h3>Description and price of goods</h3>
<p>We have taken care to describe and show items as accurately as possible. Despite this, slight variations in items may occur. We provide you with product information on https://www.leanlunch.co.uk. If there is anything which you do not understand, or if you wish to obtain further information, please contact our customer services team on .</p>
<p>Product images are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that your computer’s display of the colours accurately reflect the colour of the products. Your products may vary slightly from those images.</p>
<p>We make every effort to ensure that the pricing displayed on our website is correct. However, if an error in the pricing of a product is found we reserve the right to either cancel your order or contact you to arrange payment of any extra sum due or refund any over-payment made by you (as applicable). We reserve the right to alter all product pricing without notice.</p>
<p>All prices include VAT (where applicable) at the current rates. We reserve the right to express the price exclusive of VAT, but we shall show VAT separately and include it in the total price.
<p>Where we charge separately for packing, carriage and insurance and other relevant charges, the appropriate rates are set out in our specified pricing structure shown elsewhere on this website.</p>
<h3>Placing an order</h3>
<p>You are deemed to place an order with us by ordering via our online checkout process. As part of our checkout process you will be given the opportunity to check your order and to correct any errors. We will send you an order acknowledgement, detailing the products you have ordered.</p>
<p>The contract is subject to your right of cancellation (see below).</p>
<p>Any order placed by you for goods advertised on our website is an offer by you to purchase the goods selected in your order. No contract exists between you and us for the sale of any goods until we have received your order and accepted it (which we may do at our discretion). Our acceptance of an order takes place when we despatch the order or send you confirmation by email even if your payment has been processed immediately.</p>
<p>We may refuse at our discretion to accept an order: <br/>
(a) where we cannot obtain authorisation for your payment;<br/>
(b) if there has been a pricing or product description error; or<br/>
(c) if you do not meet any eligibility criteria set out in our terms and conditions.<br/>
(d) where goods ordered by you are not available; <br/>
(e) if we do not deliver to your area; </p>
<p>Where we do not accept your order but have processed your payment, we will re-credit your account with any amount deducted by us from your debit or credit card as soon as possible, but in any event within 30 days of your order.

We make no representation and accept no liability in respect of the export or import of the goods you purchase.</p>
<h3>Payment</h3>
<p>Payment can be made by any of the options advertised on our website. Payment shall be due before delivery. If payment fails your order will be cancelled. There will be no delivery until clear funds have been received.</p>
<p>Payment online: Our secure server software encrypts all your payment card details. The process scrambles all the information, allowing no unauthorised third party to intercept the data. Your browser will confirm that you are shopping in a secure environment by showing either a locked padlock icon or an image of a padlock next to the payment details in the relevant area of the website.</p>
<p>To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases.</p>
<p>By accepting these terms and conditions you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected. All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. During security checks we may ask for additional information or documentation to help support the data you supplied.</p>
